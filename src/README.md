# ad_classifier

This is the package which this project has created to encapsulate all interactions with the deep learning models.

## fullpipeline.py

The file FullPipeline encompasses the complete pipeline for processing MRI data to make an Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification. It uses modules for preprocessing, model loading, image extraction, prediction, and attention map generation.

A FullPipeline object is what the API uses to interact with deep learning models.
